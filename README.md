# tic-tac-toe game
I created this game for my class in [AliceCode](https://www.alicecode.org/en).

Each commit is a phase in the build of the game, and each phase has demo link.

[Phase 1](https://tic-tac-toe-phase-1.netlify.app/): In phase 1, clicking the Start Game button will create a 3x3 board, and clicking the cells will mark them with X and O. X's and O's moves aren't saved.

[Phase 2](https://tic-tac-toe-phase-2.netlify.app/): In phase 2, X's and O's moves are saved, but there is no check for winning patterns.

[Phase 3](https://tic-tac-toe-phase-3.netlify.app/): In phase 3, X's and O's moves are checked with the possible winning patterns. In this phase we declare win or draw, but the score isn't saved.

I also added a favicon.
