# tic-tac-toe game
I created this game for my class in [AliceCode](https://www.alicecode.org/en)
each commit is a phase in the build of the game, and each phase has demo link.

[Phase 1](https://tic-tac-toe-phase-1.netlify.app/): In phase 1, clicking the Start Game button will create a 3x3 board, and clicking the cells will mark them with X and O. X's and O's moves aren't saved.
